## Proper Parenthetics
My solution to class-assigned code kata. Function parentheses_check() takes a string
as parameter.The string's parentheses are added to a linked list, and the fuction
checks for closed pairs.

The function:
* Returns 1 if the string is “open” (there are open parens that are not closed)
* Returns 0 if the string is “balanced” (there are an equal number of open and closed parentheses in the string)
* Returns -1 if the string is “broken” (a closing parens has not been proceeded by one that opens)

Work for this taken from code writen for [data structures assignments](https://github.com/rveeblefetzer/data-structures) with [Marc Fieser](https://github.com/midfies).
